General stuff TODO:
- Use autoconf?
- Verify portability to various Unixes (BSD, etc)
- Port to Win32.
- Port to BeOS.
- Port to MacOS Classic.
- Port to MacOS X.
- Port to PowerPC Linux.

More immediate:
- Handle compression and other chunks in WAV files.
- Handle compression and other chunks in AIFF-C files.
- Fix the MP3 decoder; it's badly broken.
- Cleanup up VOC decoder (seems messy to me).

Decoders to implement:
- .MP3 (implemented, but buggy)
- .SHN
- .MOD
- .MID
- .CDA
- .AU
- ...and more...

Ongoing:
- look for "FIXME"s in the code.
